                HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

                HTML stands for <b>Hyper Text Markup Language</b>
                HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup
                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages
                HTML elements are represented by tags
                HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on
                Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>HTML can trace its roots back to 1989 at <b>CERN</b>, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics.
                There, Tim Berners-Lee came up with the idea of having scientists from around the world collaborate on
                research. His idea was rather than simply making documents available on a server as many people were
                doing at the time, the documents themselves should be able to link to one another, in a way that would
                enhance collaboration and make information easier to find and more accessible. From this idea Tim
                created HTML (based off SGML, an earlier markup language) to format pages and HTTP (or Hypertext
                Transfer Protocol) to transfer them from one computer to another. Although the world didn&rsquo;t quite
                realize it yet, the World Wide Web was born.</p>
            <p>Around the time that HTML 4.0 was published, a movement began to evolve HTML towards a more flexible
                style of markup language. Although authors had tried to anticipate the tags necessary to markup
                documents, the spread of the World Wide Web and the diversity of user agents made keeping up with
                requirements difficult. In the eyes of many, migrating to a markup language like XML, which allows
                authors to create their own tags to represent content, would alleviate those concerns and allow HTML to
                evolve organically. XML also contains stricter formatting rules than HTML, and a sizable number of
                authors and developers found HTML&rsquo;s lax parsing rules problematic. This effort resulted in the
                publishing of the XHTML 1.0 specification in 2000. Although it was not a dramatic departure from HTML
                4.0, it did introduce new syntax rules to conform to XML requirements and eliminated the HTML elements
                that were seen to be dictating the presentation of content rather than the structure of it. </p>
            <p><img src="images/200px-W3C_Icon.png" alt="W3C logo" width="200" height="136" class="flowLeft">Shortly
                after the 1.0 specification was published, work began on XHTML 2.0, which was to move HTML further
                towards XML. XHTML 2.0 was a dramatic departure from previous versions of HTML and was never able to
                gain any traction among browser developers. The specification languished for years in the W3C before its
                charter was revoked in 2009, essentially ending development.</p>
            <p> While the W3C was taking HTML down the XHTML path, a group of authors, developers, and organizations
                became frustrated with the lack of progress on updating HTML. This group decided to evolve HTML
                independently of the W3C and formed the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (or
                <b>WHATWG</b>) in 2004. They began work on the Web Applications 1.0 standard, which extended HTML 4.0,
                adding clear parsing rules for user agents and creating APIs to make developing web applications easier.
                The W3C, realizing that XHTML 2.0 faced significant hurdles in adoption, began working with the WHATWG
                and began to jointly develop the new standard with them in 2008. Currently the W3C works on publishing a
                stable version of the specification, while the WHATWG continues to work on what they call a &ldquo;living
                standard&rdquo; of the specification. As a living standard, they&rsquo;ve removed the version number and
                simply refer to it as &ldquo;HTML.&rdquo;</p>
